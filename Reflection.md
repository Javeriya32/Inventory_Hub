## Reflection on Using Microsoft Copilot

Microsoft Copilot assisted throughout the development of InventoryHub by generating the initial front-end 
and back-end integration code and helping connect the Blazor client with the Minimal API.
It was especially helpful in debugging issues such as incorrect API routes, CORS errors, and JSON deserialization problems.

Copilot also helped structure nested JSON responses and suggested performance optimizations like reducing redundant API calls and caching server-side data.
Overall, Copilot improved development speed, code clarity, and helped follow best practices in full-stack application development.
